Find routes on a ski mountain

This is a program to find paths from one point to another on a ski mountain (Sunday River, with this data set).

Input files used:
- nodes.json - representation of trail/ lift start points, end points, and intersections
- trails.json - list of trails, lifts, and trail segments
- closed_trails.txt - text file with trails that are closed
- Shoyer_Steve_assignment1_06.py - Python source for the implementation

The data files are not totally accurate or complete, but I'm working on them.
