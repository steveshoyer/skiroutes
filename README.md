Find routes on a ski mountain

This is a program to find paths from one point to another on a ski mountain (Sunday River, with this data set).

Input files used:
- nodes.json - representation of trail/ lift start points, end points, and intersections
- trails.json - list of trails, lifts, and trail segments
- closed_trails.txt - text file with trails that are closed
- Shoyer_Steve_assignment1_06.py - Python source for the implementation

The data files are not totally accurate or complete, but I'm working on them.

To run the program, download the files and run the Python program (I used Spyder for development) with the data files in the same directory.
